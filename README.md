# 3D-Web-Interface

This interface was made for a school project in partnership with La Redoute.

The whole scene was made in Blender and then exported with GLTFLoader to be used with Three.js.

The GLTF file with the whole scene in Blender is in the link below and has to be in the same folder as the main.js
